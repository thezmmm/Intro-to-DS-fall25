The first junk chart I think it's what I made in Exercise2-4. Here I draw pairplot for all variables including categorical and numerical. But I don't think the pair of categorical value - categorical value makes sense, it just leaves some points. I know the better way to fix it is to use a bar chart to compare the count, and I have done it in Exercise2 - 3.

First, the lines connecting the points in this data table are not smooth enough. I believe this is because the sampling intervals are not short enough. In other words, the broken line drawn from the plotted data is meaningless in my view. And it states that samples were collected over only two days. Expecting to derive generalizable results from such a small sample size is rather impossible.

This chart forces three different types of data into a comparison, which is somewhat strained. It is neither convenient for comparison nor for observation. Therefore, I split it into three charts, plotting bar charts and line charts simultaneously to compare and illustrate the trends.
